This report is in regard to the Design Sell project, as part of MEAN Stack Training programme.

Aim: To develop a Design Sell webpage, where the user can sell the templates of the websites he developed.

Project:
In this project, I have created a html file with the name template.html. I used tags like h1, table, form, 
button, div and many other tags on this page. I have linked a css file named temp.css to this html file 
using the link tag in the head part.

<h1>
I used this heading tag to create a heading on the top of the page and added the css properties like
text-align, font-family, background color and text color.

<table>
I used the table tag to create a table showing the deals for the day on the website and provided many css 
properties like margin, border, text-align and background-color to it. I also included the th and td tags 
for these properties while using the multispecific selector in the css file.

<div>
I used the div tag especially to hold the description text as in a container. I added css properties like
border, background-color, margin, padding and font-size to the container.

<p>
I used the paragraph tag to write the contents and description on the page. I have included the properties
like font-family, font-weight, text-decoration-line in the css page for this tag inside the div container.

<button>
I used the button tag to create a buy button at the end of the page after selecting the items in the select tag.
I added the css properties like border, background-color and text-align to this element.

As a result, I developed a html page with css properties for many of the elements present in the html file.
I have included various properties and also used different types of selectors to meet the project goal.
