        <p class = "sideheaders">Static Blog 12</p>
        <p>Static Blog 12 is much as it sounds -static, fixed, constant. 
            This is to say that it is designed, stored on a server, and 
            delivered to the user's web browser as-is. It doesn't change
            between the point when the developer hits the save button, and 
            when the end user clicks on it.
        </p>
        <p class = "sideheaders">Dynamic Blog 21</p>
        <p>Blogs are usually dynamic, because the posts and categories automatically
            display the content in reverse chronological order. If you choose
            WordPress, you can even use plugins to make the content display even more
            dynamically. 
        </p>
        <p class = "sideheaders">WebX Pro 2</p>
        <p>WebX Pro 2 is a professional website, which can be considered a combination
            of a multi-dimensional resume, a personal website and an online identity.
            It can be considered a multidimensional resume because it is built with the
            basic constructs of a resume and has added interactive elements only available
            with a website interface.
